                    <p>TritonsPrime's Mission is to help you get your nfts to buyers and get paid seamlessly.
                        We believe that one day, nearly everything we own will be accounted for on a blockchain. That’s why our goal is to build a trusted, inclusive, and accessible marketplace that welcomes everyone into the world of NFTs

                    <h3>Why NFTs?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Blockchain technology reimagines the distribution of value, the same way the internet transformed the distribution of information, and NFTs are one of the first major applications of this new technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>Artists can now sell digital 1/1 pieces with the same verifiable ownership and scarcity as a physical artwork, and earn recurring creator earnings for the first time in history. Games can use blockchain technology to facilitate cross-game experiences and economies (like buying gear and being able to use it across multiple games). Events like Coachella can leverage NFTs to make it easier to grant, buy, and sell tickets or issue lifetime passes. Brands can use NFTs to provide exclusive access to perks, communities and events. Inventory can be remotely managed with NFTs, where the NFTs are eventually exchanged for physical goods. And this is only the beginning!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        NFTs represent the building blocks for new peer to peer economies, where users have greater freedom and ownership over their digital items and data, and developers can build powerful applications to provide real economic value directly to users with fewer middlemen.
                        We believe NFTs will help people realize the broad value and impact of true digital ownership.
                    </p>
